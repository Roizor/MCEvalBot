# Setup
## Install

```
npm i 
```

## Run

### Automatic Restart
```
node run.js <ip>
``` 

### No Restart

node . <ip>

## Configure

Enter a different user than the one you are running the bot on into config.json, with the password specified.
Then, add your user to not require a sudo password when running sudo (I recommend doing this in a VM and NOT your host)
